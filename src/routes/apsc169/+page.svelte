		<h1>My Reflection on APSC169</h1>
		<p>
			Throughout this course I gained a much clearer understanding of the Engineering Design
			process, especially the idea that it is deeply iterative. I learned that it is normal and
			often necessary to revisit earlier steps as new challenges appear. Seeing how designs evolve
			through repeated refinement helped me understand that iteration is not a setback but an
			essential part of engineering work.
		</p>
		<p>
			My experiences also showed me that communication and creativity are central attributes of an
			engineer. This course pushed me to explore solutions that had not been tried before, and I had
			to communicate those ideas clearly to my team through discussions and written reports. I
			realized that even strong technical ideas have little impact if they cannot be shared and
			understood.
		</p>
		<p>
			The life cycle analysis and stakeholder assessments were especially eye opening. They helped
			me see how engineers carry significant ethical responsibilities. A single inethical or
			uninformed decision can have long term consequences for communities and the environment. This
			made the professional obligations of engineers feel much more real.
		</p>
		<p>
			One strength I discovered was my ability to write effectively when I care about the topic.
			Even though writing has never been my favourite part of school, the relevance of this project
			motivated me and allowed me to excel.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also identified areas where I want to grow. I want to improve my prototyping skills by
			becoming more confident with CAD so I can bring ideas into tangible form earlier in the design
			process. I also want to get better at balancing detailed work with big picture thinking by
			stepping back more often to check how my decisions align with project goals. By focusing on
			these areas I can continue developing into a more capable engineer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Overall, Sustainable Engineering with Dr. Bam and Dr. Eisenstein introduced me to what it
			means to be an engineer. I'm excited to embark on this life changing journey and can't wait to
			see what there is to learn. Thanks for amazing semester :)
